**Notes**

- Introduction to Problem Solving
    - Algorithm is simply a processs or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
    - Algorithm is the foundation for being a successful problem solving developer
    - How to improve problem solving cognition
        - Understand the problem
        - Explore concrete examples
        - Break it down
        - Devise a plan for solving problems
        - Solve / Simplify
        - Look back and refactor
    - Unrelated but also master common problem solving patterns

- Understand the problem
    - Regardless of the technologies and language being used, it's really imortant to have astrong problem-Solving skill set and a lot of it will come with time and practice
    - Before getting started on actions to solve a problem, it's really important to sit back and just make sure you understand the task ahead.
    - To check if you truly understand the problem, you may want to evaluate your response to these questions.
        - Can I restate / rephrase correctly the problem in my own words?
        - What are the inputs that go into or requirements for the problem?
        - What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
        - Can the outputs be determined from the imputs? in other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
        - How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

- Explore Concrete Examples
    - Try to come up with concrete examples of the problem. This is tied closely to understanding the problem better
    - Examples also provide sanity checks that our eventual solution works how it should
    - You can also learn more information by doing these examples
    - Learn to start with simple examples
    - Progress to more complex examples
    - Explore examples with empty and invalid inputs

- Break it down
    - It's highly recommended to explicitly write out the steps you need to take
    - This forces you to think about the code you will write before you write it, and it helps you catch any lingering conceptual issues or misundertandings before you dive in and have to worry about details (e.g language / syntax) as well

- Solve or Simplify
    - Solve the problem. if you can't, solve a simpler problem!
    - You don't have to be able to solve it 100% before starting
    - Even if you know that you will get stuck along the line, it's much better to get started and figure yourself out along the line
    - It's pretty common that in simplifying a problem, you will gain insight into the actual solution ans something will fall into place
    - To simplify, find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
    - temporarily ignore that difficulty
    - Write a simplified solution. AT this point, you may likely find a solution to your actual difficulty
    - Then incorporate that difficulty back in

- Look back and Refactor
    - Your code works but you aren't done yet
    - This is probably the most important step when it comes to improving and becoming a better developer
    - It's really important to strive and improve your works
    - These are couple of questions to ask concerning REFACTORING:
        - Can you check the result? make sure your codes works
        - Can you derive the result differently? is there other ways to solve it?
        - Can you understand it at a glance?
        - Can you use the result or method for some other problem? this help develops you spider sense and make you think intuitvely
        - Can you improve the performance of youe solution?
        - Can you think of other ways to refactor? make your code legible, neat and follow suitable guidelines
        - How have other people solved this problem? You can really learn a lot from seeing other people's approach and implementation to the same solution
    - Looking back, reflecting and refactoring is really important
